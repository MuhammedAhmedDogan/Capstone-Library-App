# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a full-stack application designed to streamline the management of books, borrowers, and transactions within a library. The system is built with a robust backend using Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, while the frontend is created using React, along with modern UI libraries and tools such as React Router, Material-UI, and FontAwesome.

## Features

- â€¢ **Book Management** : Add, update, and delete books along with their categories, authors, and publishers.
- â€¢ **Borrowing Records** : Track and manage borrowing and returning of books by library members.
- â€¢ **Real-time Data Updates** : Fetch and display up-to-date data using React's state management.
- â€¢ **User-friendly Interface** : Intuitive design and navigation for efficient library management.

## Technologies Used

### Back-End

- â€¢ **Java Spring Boot** : Handles business logic, RESTful APIs, and data management.
- â€¢ **PostgreSQL** : Provides a stable and secure database for storing library information.

### Front-End

- â€¢ **React** : Manages state and renders interactive UI components.
- â€¢ **React Router** : Enables dynamic routing for smooth navigation between pages.
- â€¢ **Material-UI** : Provides a modern and consistent UI design.

## Future Improvements
